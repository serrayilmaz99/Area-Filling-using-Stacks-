In this homework, I implemented an area filling program which makes use of stack data structure.
Area filling is the process of filling a connected and closed area in a map with a given value (color or a filling character).
The map is a 2D array with solid boundary and some occupied cells within itself. 
A connected and closed area in this map contains consecutive empty cells surrounded by the boundary and/or occupied cells. 
Such an area can be of any shape (including amorphous shapes). 
In the program, the user will enter a coordinate of an empty cell of an area in the map. 
After that, the program fills all the empty cells in the corresponding area with a filling character. 
An example of such matrix is added to files.
